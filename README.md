Juraj Pančík - Autocompletor
=================================

Web tool created for translators to increase their effectivity. Provides autocomplete-like interface when translating from original language to target language.

## Running

First launch

    $ ./activator

from the root of the project. This script will install Play Framework activator and dependencies and open SBT console for you. Then you there are two ways to run the application in development mode.

## Populating DB

Inside conf/application.conf specify DB connection URL for Postgres, default is:

    slick.dbs.default.db.url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bachelorthesis?user=jurajpancik&password="    
    
You have to obtain valid .csv file containing "*originalPhrase,translatedPhrase,directProbability,lexicalWeight*". You can obtain this .csv file by running *scripts/phrase-table-to-csv.py* Python script on phrase table generated by Moses. After that, you have to run following SQL commands to populate DB. You can find these commands inside *scripts/sql-commands.sql*. First create table:

    CREATE TABLE "phrases" ("original" TEXT, "translation" TEXT, "directProbability" TEXT, "lexicalWeighting" TEXT);
    
Then load data into it:

    COPY phrases FROM '/Users/jurajpancik/dbdata.csv' delimiter ',' CSV;

And finally create hash index for faster select command:

    CREATE index phrase_idx ON phrases USING HASH (original);
    
Now you can try if everything works by running for example (replace testWordHere for word in original language):

    SELECT * FROM phrases WHERE phrases.original='testWordHere';
